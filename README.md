                                                  TRENDS di MERCATO


The project was born from the desire to help companies position their services, products and their image in a more advantageous way on the market. Through data analysis we try to intercept and
interpret one or more trends in a market of interest, i.e. an element of a context that serves to have a broader vision of the performance of the KPI's. Above all, try to make it clear when a service/product is becoming obsolete.

Through the query of APIs and Web Scraping techniques we can query the web to analyze information, deducing a present and future trend for one or more specific search keys provided.

The project is made up of 5 areas of analysis, through the possibility of writing one or more keywords in a specific section and obtaining the search results via text and graphic output.


The areas of analysis are based on 5 areas:
1. Keyword and Search volumes analysis
2. Advance research
3. Sentiment analysis
4. Brand reputation
5. Price comparison
6. Forecasting
